# Global Warming

Global warming is the long-term gradual increase of the Earths surface, atmosphere and its oceans. A change that is believed to be permanently changing the Earths climate. Since the industrial period (between 1850-1900) there has been a reported increase in the Earths temperature largely due to human activities, such as fossil fuel burning, land clearing and agriculture, that has caused an increase in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses in the Earths atmosphere.  The continued rising levels of greenhouse gasses means that future generations will be presented with more extreme weather events, rising temperatures, rising sea levels due to the melting of polar ice caps, as well as disruption to marine and land ecosystems. 

The aim of this project is to explore the data surounding global warming and its effects.  The data presented aims to bring awareness to the impending global crisis and to aid in conversations regarding mitigative efforts and solutions. Can we slow or even reverse global warming? Is it too late?
